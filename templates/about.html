      <p class="question">Why does this website exist?</p>
      <p>Representation of minorities in the media (or lack thereof) is a real and serious problem.
      This site is a tool for writers who would rather be a part of the solution than the problem.</p>
      <p class="question">What does the website do?</p>
      <p>This website randomly generates characters with a list of traits according to their actual likelihood.
      So, for instance, around half of the characters generated by the site will be female.</p>
      <p class="question">Why are there so few sexual orientations and gender identities represented?</p>
      <p>The best statistics we found included only A/Bi/Hetero/Homo-sexuality and Cis/Trans-genderism. If you know
      of more comprehensive surveys, please let us know.</p>
      <p class="question">How did you deal with correlation between different traits?</p>
      <p>We mostly didn't deal with that at all. Instead, we assumed that each trait was independent from each
      other trait. The result of that is that the representation of trait combinations might be skewed (too many
      male bisexuals, perhaps), but the representation of each individual trait will be correct. Obviously
      we would have liked to take correlation into account, but we don't have statistics on everything. </p>
